The Mechanics of rating Phishing Emails

# How to use this tool:
Guidance notes are provided on cells tagged with a 'red triangle'. Hover over these for more information.

# Summary of simulations sheet:
- This sheet 'Summary of Simulations' is an auto-generated summary that presents the difficulty rating of your campaigns, assuming a monthly phishing program. The "Overall Difficulty" of each campaign is calculated based on the "Premise alignment" and "Difficulty rating from cue types". The Overall Difficulty is determined from a weighted average. By default, 40% weighting is placed on the premise alignment, and 60% weighting is placed on the cue types. You may customise this weighting in the orange cells. You may re-name the exercise name to suit your simulation.

# Campaign Grading Criteria sheet:
- When grading the difficulty of a simulation, you will use the "Campaign Grading Criteria" sheet. Examples are completed for you on the sheet. 
- When grading new similations, you will be editing the drop-down menus in Column G and Column L. Highlighted in red boxes are the inputs you are required to edit according to your campaign.
